Let's simulate an actual coffee machine! What do we need for that? This coffee machine will have a limited supply of water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups. Also, it will calculate how much money it gets for selling coffee.

There are several options for the coffee machine we want you to implement: first, it should sell coffee. It can make different types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Of course, each variety requires a different amount of supplies, however, in any case, you will need only one disposable cup for a drink. Second, the coffee machine must get replenished by a special worker. 
Third, another special worker should be able to take out money from the coffee machine.
The program that will work endlessly to make coffee for all interested persons until the shutdown signal is given. The options: "buy", "fill",
"take", "remaining" and "exit".
We can be out of resources for making coffee. If the coffee machine doesn't have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee.

And the last improvement to the program at this step â€” if the user types "buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, they should be able to type "back" to return into the main cycle.
